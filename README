foxy
====

A simple script that handles bookmarks stored in txt file. It's written so that
one can quickly open his bookmarks that are stored in a plain text file to an
already running firefox session through the terminal. I mostly run this script
from a tabbed window in i3 window manager (2 tabs: firefox and terminal) as 
the focus returns to firefox after running the -o option.

options
=======

-h
	show usage message and quit.

-s @tag:
	search for a tag in $BOOKMARKS file. Currently foxy can search only for
	one tag.

	e.g. foxy -s @search-engine
		1 https://www.duckduckgo.com

To open this link we then use -o option:

-o [n]
	open the nth link as listed from the -s option.

	e.g. foxy -o 1

-a LINK @tag1 @tag2...@tagn
	add LINK as a bookmark with tags from 1 to [n].

	e.g. foxy -a http://www.google.com @search-engine @google

-t
	show all bookmark tags filtered with uniq(1).
