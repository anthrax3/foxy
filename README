NOTE: In order to work properly, foxy needs dmenu.

foxy
====

A simple script that handles bookmarks stored in txt file. It's written so that
one can quickly open his bookmarks that are stored in a plain text file to an
already running firefox session using dmenu.

options
=======

-h
	show usage message and quit.

You can run foxy with the below options directly from dmenu:

-s tag
	search for a tag in $BOOKMARKS file. Currently foxy can search only for
	one tag. Show the search results using dmenu so the user can choose a
	link.
	
	e.g. foxy -s search-engine

-a LINK @tag1 @tag2...@tagn
	add LINK as a bookmark with tags from 1 to [n].

	e.g. foxy -a http://www.google.com @search-engine @google

-t
	show all bookmark tags filtered with uniq(1).

-n
	show the number of stored bookmarks. There's no point to use dmenu
for this option. Just use your terminal.

fmarks
======

Another simple script that can be used with or without foxy but I find it quite
handy anyway. fmarks helps you open your favourite pages from the pages.txt
file.

options
=======

if no option is passed to fmarks, it assumes you want to open a page with surf.

-f
	fmarks will open the page with firefox

-h	show help message and exit

Bugs
====

If a proper number of arguments is passed to foxy when using the -a flag,
it can't tell if the user passed a proper URL
