NOTE: In order to work properly, foxy needs dmenu.

foxy
====

A simple script that handles bookmarks stored in txt file. It's written so that
one can quickly open his bookmarks that are stored in a plain text file to an
already running firefox session using dmenu.

options
=======

-h
	show usage message and quit.

You can run foxy with the below options directly from dmenu:

-s tag
	search for a tag in $bookmarks file. Currently foxy can search only for
	one tag. Show the search results using dmenu so the user can choose a
	link.
	
	e.g. foxy -s search-engine

-a LINK @tag1 @tag2...@tagn
	add LINK as a bookmark with tags from 1 to [n].

	e.g. foxy -a http://www.google.com @search-engine @google

-b @tag1 @tag2...@tagn
   	This option works only for firefox. It saves your current firefox session
	to your bookmarks file. The same tags are used for all the links in your
	firefox session. To use the -b option you must have installed the
	session exporter[1] add-on. For the time being -b assumes it's called
	properly so handle with care. Keep a back-up of your bookmarks file
	before trying this option. 

-t
	show all bookmark tags filtered with uniq(1).

-n
	show the number of stored bookmarks. There's no point to use dmenu
	for this option. Just use your terminal.

-c tag
	show number of bookmarks that are tagged with "tag"

-d tag
	Delete a bookmark. Search bookmarks for "tag", pipe output to dmenu,
	select and delete bookmark. There's an option to open to your browser the
	bookmark you chose to delete if you uncomment 2 lines. Read the foxy src for
	details.

fmarks
======

Another simple script that can be used with or without foxy but I find it quite
handy anyway. fmarks helps you open your favourite pages from the pages.txt
file.

options
=======

if no option is passed to fmarks, it assumes you want to open a page with surf.

-f
	fmarks will open the page with firefox

-h	show help message and exit

Bugs
====

If a proper number of arguments is passed to foxy when using the -a flag,
it can't tell if the user passed a proper URL
